How to Send HTTP data to Cribl Stream via Python3

Step 0. Complete the following Prereq:
1.  How to add Nginx in front of Cribl in Docker
for free! :

Step 1: Know the difference between Cribl HTTP/s,
Raw HTTP/s, and Splunk HEC


Cribl HTTP/S:
The Cribl HTTP Source receives data from a 
Cribl HTTP Destination in the same 
Distributed deployment

ref:https://docs.cribl.io/stream/sources-cribl-http/

RAW HTTP/S:
The Raw HTTP Source listens on a specific port, 
captures every HTTP request to that port, 
and creates a corresponding event that it 
pushes to its configured Event Breakers.

ref:https://docs.cribl.io/stream/sources-raw-http/

Splunk HEC:
Its for Splunk agents to send data to,
or if you previously configured splunk HEC endpoint
in Splunk, you can replace it with one in Cribl
Stream.

Step 2:  Make sure docker is running and the
previously created environment is up and running
(from the prerequisite)

2 methods here -> docker ps   OR   docker desktop

Step 3.  Add the HTTP data source in Cribl Stream

Manage -> Data -> Sources -> Raw HTTP -> Enable

Commit -> Deploy

Step 4.  Log into the ubuntu instance we created
in the prerequisite (Step 0)

docker exec -it criblwithnginx-ubuntu-1 bash

Step 5. Download and install Python3 & Python-pip3

apt update
apt install python3 python3-pip -y

Step 6. Using pip, install requests lib

pip install requests

Step 7. Open the "live" view of your new raw http
input in Cribl Stream.  Set capture time to 300s or
enough time for you to complete step 8.  (You can 
always restart the capture)

Step 8. Using python, import requests lib and post
some data:

python3 

import requests
url = "http://criblwithnginx-workers-1:10080"
data = '{"test":"onlyAtest"}'
requests.post(url,data=data,verify=False)

Step 9.  PRofit!!!!

Step 10.  Subscribe and Share -> Ring the bell!
