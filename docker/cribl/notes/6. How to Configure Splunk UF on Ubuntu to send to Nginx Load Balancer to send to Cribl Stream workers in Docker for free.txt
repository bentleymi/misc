Step 2. Make sure the environment is running

Using docker desktop or for CLI

Windows:
start -> run -> cmd

docker ps

Step 3. Forget about NGINX - The agent will use
software load balancing with this integration

Step 4. Log into your Cribl Leader and enable the
in_splunk_tcp input for your worker group...

Manage -> default (worker group) -> data 
-> sources -> Splunk TCP

Click on "Enabled" button next to in_splunk_tcp, 
then click on in_splunk_tcp to open the 
configuration settings

Browse to advance settings, change max s2s version 
to 4, and leave the rest as is and click save.

Now commit and deploy...

Step 5. Log into your ubuntu container

Windows:
start -> run -> cmd

docker exec -it criblwithnginx-ubuntu-1 bash

Step 6. Download and verify the UF image:

curl -L -o splunkforwarder-9.2.0.1-d8ae995bf219-linux-2.6-amd64.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/9.2.0.1/linux/splunkforwarder-9.2.0.1-d8ae995bf219-linux-2.6-amd64.deb"
curl -L -o splunkforwarder-9.2.0.1-d8ae995bf219-linux-2.6-amd64.deb.md5 "https://download.splunk.com/products/universalforwarder/releases/9.2.0.1/linux/splunkforwarder-9.2.0.1-d8ae995bf219-linux-2.6-amd64.deb.md5"
openssl md5 splunkforwarder-9.2.0.1-d8ae995bf219-linux-2.6-amd64.deb | diff -w splunkforwarder-9.2.0.1-d8ae995bf219-linux-2.6-amd64.deb.md5 -

If no differences in the md5 hash, 
then the download can be trusted.

Step 7.  Install the UF:

dpkg -i splunkforwarder-9.2.0.1-d8ae995bf219-linux-2.6-amd64.deb

Step 8.  Add your cribl worker instances as 
outputs for the UF & start it up.

echo "[tcpout:cribl-stream]" > /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/outputs.conf
echo "server=criblwithnginx-workers-1:9997,criblwithnginx-workers-2:9997" >> /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/outputs.conf

/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk start --accept-license --answer-yes

create admin user/pass

ps -ef | grep splunk

Step 9. Verify data is flowing in Cribl using the 
"Live" view of the in_splunk_tcp source.
