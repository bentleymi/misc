cd criblWithNginx
notepad docker-compose.yml

paste in contents of "docker-
compose.yml" from link below
"https://github.com/bentleymi/
misc/tree/main/docker/cribl"

Step 4. Run docker compose:

docker compose up -d --scale 
workers=2

Step 5. Create a new nginx stream
configuration:

docker exec -it criblwithnginx-nginx-1 /bin/sh
apk add nginx-mod-stream
mv /etc/nginx/conf.d/stream.conf /etc/nginx/stream.conf
echo 'include /etc/nginx/stream.conf;' >> /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
vi /etc/nginx/stream.d/5140.conf

Press "i" for "insert"
Paste in the 5140.conf file from 
github

server {
 listen 5140;
 proxy_pass 5140_tcp_backend;
}

upstream 5140_tcp_backend {
 least_conn;
 server criblWithNginx-workers-1:5140;
 server criblWithNginx-workers-2:5140;
}

Press "escape" key, then 
type ":wq" and press
