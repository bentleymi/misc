Step 2. Modify the docker-compose.yml for the 
criblWithNginx project we created in Step 1.

Windows: 
Start -> Run -> CMD

cd criblwithnginx
notepad docker-compose.yml

replaced the contents with those found on our 
github:  

github.com/bentleymi/misc/blob/main/docker/cribl/
docker-compose1.yml

Save the file:  alt + f then s  OR file -> save


Step 3. Delete the old environment.

Step 4. Use docker compose to rebuild the environment
docker compose up -d --scale workers=2

Step 5. Install Cribl Stream on Ubuntu:
docker exec -it criblwithnginx-ubuntu-1 bash

apt-get update && apt-get install curl -y
cd /opt
curl -Lso - $(curl https://cdn.cribl.io/dl/latest-x64) | tar zxv
/opt/cribl/bin/cribl start

Step 6. Open the Ubuntu Cribl UI in a browser
http://localhost:9001/stream
user:  admin
pass:  admin
Register the product, tell them we sent you
change your password

Step 7. Add your NGINX instance as a Data Destination
click data -> destinations -> syslog

click "add destination"
Give it an output ID
Add the destination:  criblwithnginx-nginx-1:5140
Click save

Step 8. Log into the Manager, Capture data, and run 
the test from the ubuntu instance.

Login to manager
Go to home -> click on your default worker group
OR 
Go to manage -> click on the worker group
Go to data -> sources -> syslog
Click on live, stop, capture, make sure capture 
time is over a minute or so.  120s is great.
Click on start

On ubuntu instance:
Click on syslog output, then test tab, and run test

If you get "success" then you should see data in 
Cribl preview/live capture from the manager.

Step 9. Share with your family and friends.

Step 10.  PROFIT!!!
